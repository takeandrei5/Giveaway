## Description 

#### Web application where users have the possibility create listings of items they do not longer need and wish to give them to others who might make more use of them instead of throwing them out. 

#### Once a user has found an item of interest, they can login and either contact the seller via sending a message inside the application or see the contact details, which are normally hidden, of the seller. The development of the application is split into five stages.

#### My goal for this project is not only to create a platform in order to alleviate the problem which I've detailed above, but also for me to learn by applying various software development concepts.

## Stages

### Stage 1
#### Basic CRUD - the user can create/update/delete/fetch listings and can login via Auth0; the images are uploaded to Cloudflare CDN

### Stage 2
#### Add Jenkins CI/CD pipeline and start shipping staging builds; Optimise devops; Add caching e.g. Redis

### Stage 3
#### Users can communicate with eachother via the built-in real-time chat; Also add notifications email/desktop notifications

### Stage 4 
#### Add mapbox for accurate location

### Stage 5 
#### Beautify the application (hopefully earlier)
